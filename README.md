# Electric Vehicle Scheduling Problem with Charging Restrictions (EVSP-CR)
This repository contains the code developed as part of the thesis titled **"Electric Vehicle Assignment Problem with Limited Capacity Charging Stations"**.

## Description
The objective of this work is to model and solve the electric vehicle assignment problem considering the limited capacity of charging stations. Mathematical models and optimization algorithms were developed to find efficient solutions.


## Requirements
To run the code, it is recommended to use Python 3.8 or later. Install dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In each folder you will find an .ipynb which can create a random instance and optimize the problem.


## Usage The main scripts can be executed as follows: ```bash
python scripts/model_arcs.py
```

```bash
python scripts/model_routes.py
```

To run the LOWRES heuristic:
```bash
python scripts/heuristic.py
```

## Thesis Data
The test datasets used in the experiments are available in the `data/` folder.
